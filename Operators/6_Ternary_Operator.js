// The Ternary Operator in JavaScript is a shortcut for writing simple if-else statements. 
// Itâ€™s also known as the Conditional Operator because it works based on a condition.

/* How Does the Ternary Operator Work?
    The ternary operator works with three parts:
    1. Condition: A statement that returns true or false.
    2. Value if True: What happens if the condition is true?
    3. Value if False: What happens if the condition is false? */

// Syntax -> condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression
